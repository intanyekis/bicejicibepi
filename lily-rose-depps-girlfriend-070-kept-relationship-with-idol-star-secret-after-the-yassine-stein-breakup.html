How did Depp and 070 meet each other?</p><h2 id=how-did-lily-rose-depp-and-070-shake-meet>How Did Lily-Rose Depp And 070 Shake Meet?</h2><p>Fans never found out the reason for <a href=#>Lily Rose-Depp and Timothee Chalamet's split</a>. But every time Lily-Rose Depp is in a new relationship, fans discover the news through photos or public appearances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lily-rose-depp-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily-Rose Depp posted about 070 Shake</a>, who has been part of the <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> industry for a little while, on Instagram Stories in May 2023 and wrote “4 MONTHS W MY CRUSH.” The couple kissed, making it clear that they were together. Several publications took note when Depp wished 070 Shake a happy birthday in June 2023 and wrote "Happy birthday love of my life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Lily Rose Depp's Relationship Like With Her Famous Parents, Johnny Depp And Vanessa Paradis?</a></span></p><p>There have been countless photos of Lily-Rose Depp and 070 Shake. They have been pictured walking around New York City with coffee and also at Paris Fashion Week.</p><p>Everyone wants to know how the couple met, but unfortunately, neither Depp nor 070 Shake has shared that story. And they haven't mentioned their relationship in interviews, either. Depp has talked about how much she cares about her girlfriend on Instagram, but that's about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/070-shake.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible that Lily-Rose Depp and 070 Shake met at a party or perhaps because a mutual friend thought they would like each other. Or maybe they followed each other on Instagram and began chatting. While fans would love to know, it doesn't seem that the couple wants to share this information with the public.</p><h2 id=why-is-lily-rose-depp-and-070-shake-39-s-relationship-so-private>Why Is Lily-Rose Depp And 070 Shake's Relationship So Private?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily-Rose Depp was interviewed</a> by Elle in 2022 and said that she isn't used to talking about her personal life all the time. She said, “I am here to do my job, and what I really want to put out into the world is my work.”</p><p>Depp also said, "But I’ve just been raised in a manner that has taught me that privacy is something that’s important to protect."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lily-rose-depp.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp described herself as an "open book" around her pals, which suggests that they know more about her relationship with 070 Shake than the public does.</p><p>While Depp has dated many celebrities in the past, it seems that she has tried to keep all of them as secret as possible. She didn't give long interviews about Austin Butler or Timothee Chalamet. It makes sense that she hasn't talked about 070 Shake besides a few Instagram posts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between The Weeknd And Lily-Rose Depp?</a></span></p><p>Even though Depp has been a known figure since childhood, she doesn't seem to think of herself as a celebrity. When interviewed by Entertainment Weekly, she said that she and her The Idol character Jocelyn aren't exactly the same.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp said, "I mean, my parents definitely did their best to give my brother and I the most 'normal' childhood that we could have. Obviously, still not totally normal, but a sense of normalcy at least, and a sense of childhood and freedom and play and everything. So our childhoods are quite different."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/070-shake-singing.jpg><p>Depp continued to Entertainment Weekly, "Of course, experiencing this industry from a young age, there's obviously pieces of that that help me understand maybe Jocelyn's perspective a little bit better, but still, definitely coming from different places."</p><p>Because Depp says that she had a "normal childhood," she might be trying to live a regular life as much as possible. And that means not talking about dating 070 Shake all that much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Lily Rose-Depp doesn't always announce a new relationship right away, she doesn't seem to like talking about her break-ups, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lily-rose-depp.jpg><p>Before she started seeing 070 Shake, Depp was in a relationship with the rapper Yassine Stein. Fans aren't sure why they broke up, though. When a relationship has run its course, Depp seems to move on privately. And since she posted about dating 070 Shake when they had been together for four months, it seems that she likes to see how a relationship is going before making it public.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lily-Rose Depp Battled A Horrible Disease</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Nicki Swift, Yassine Stein and Lily-Rose Depp could have ended their relationship in September 2022 or a bit after that. The Daily Mail shared pictures of Depp and Stein holding hands and walking around New York City. It seems that the couple started dating in October 2021. They must have been together for around a year.</p><p>070 Shake seems to be as private as Lily-Rose Depp. She has only posted ten times on her Instagram account. Instead of using social media to promote her music 24/7, she seems to only share what she wants to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lily-rose-depp-s-girlfriend-070-has-a-mysterious-relationship-with-the-idol-star-here-s-the-truth-about-how-they-met-and-kept-things-secret-after-the-yassine-stein-breakup.jpg><p>The 26-year-old rapper has put out two albums. "Modus Vivend" came out in 2020 and "You Can't Kill Me" came out in 2022. While The Guardian gave this second album only two stars, the reviewer did mention 070 Shake's "distinctive voice." She is definitely a unique artist who is sharing her passion for music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Depp and 070 Shake may never say anything more about their romance, it doesn't seem like things could be going any better. Since Depp called her girlfriend "the love of my life," fans can defintiely expect this couple to go the distance, and everyone is rooting for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqSpYr%2Bwv8Rmm56ooKh6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW58lmlkpJ2gqXqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMsKCtoF2esbC4jKyrmqpdqLKkvsStZJqepJq%2FbsDHnmSymaOotq%2BxjKyrnqGeYq%2BzscCkrKln</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mariah-amato-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-33317-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Mariah Amato Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a>
