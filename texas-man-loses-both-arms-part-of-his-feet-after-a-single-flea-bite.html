of his arms and part of his feet, his family said.</p><p>Michael Kohlhof was rushed to a San Antonio emergency room last month after losing feeling in his toes and suffering from what his family initially believed to be severe flu symptoms, his mother wrote in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe</a>.</p><p>Soon after, the 35-year-old man went into septic shock and was rushed into the ICU.</p><p>Within 24 hours, Kohlhof was put on a ventilator, dialysis, antibiotics, vasopressors and numerous IV medications to keep him alive as his organs began rapidly failing.</p><p>“By the end of June 20, I was told to call immediate family to come from all parts of the country to say their goodbyes,” mom J’Leene Hardaway wrote.</p><p>Kohlhof’s brother Greg <a href=#>told KENS5</a> that his sibling “almost died once or twice.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Michael pictured without both of his hands, a necessary amputation that prevents further complications from the typhus. <span class=credit>Gofundme/JLeene Hardaway</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Michael’s family has said he is doing surprisingly well following multiple limb amputations. <span class=credit>FOX26</span></figure><p>“They were worried about him being brain dead,” Greg said.</p><p>It took another 11 days of intense medical assistance, but Kohlhof miraculously pulled through and was taken off the ventilator and sedation on July 1 — but not without severe physical consequences.</p><p>According to Hardaway, Kohlhof’s hands and feet developed dry gangrene as a result of the vasopressor treatment — one of the many medications that saved his life.</p><p>The cause of Kohlof’s sepsis and quick decline was pinpointed to typhus, which stemmed from a single bite from a flea.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Michael’s health issues arose from a rare type of typhus that caused him to go into septic shock. <span class=credit>FOX26</span></figure><p>“He was the victim of a severe and traumatic bite from one single flea,” Hardaway said.</p><p>Doctors told the family that the type of typus Kohlhof suffered is extremely rare in the US.</p><p>According to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, flea-borne typhus occurs in tropical and subtropical climates around the world, including areas of the United Stateflea bit nys — namely southern California, Hawaii and Texas.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Michael’s family has become his support group as he navigates the complications of having multiple limbs amputated. <span class=credit>FOX26</span></figure><p>“Untreated [typhus] can cause severe illness and damage to one or more organs, including the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain,” the CDC warns.</p><p>Typically, people bitten by <a href=#>infected fleas</a> seek medical help after finding a swelling or a rash around the bite mark, but Greg said his brother didn’t experience any symptoms until it was too late.</p><p>Kohlhof’s gangrene was beyond treatment and doctors were forced to amputate both his hands up to his forearms as well as half of his feet earlier this week.</p><p>If he had waited another 48 hours, “he would have not made it,” his partner Alishpa Masood <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told&nbsp;KHOU11.</a></p><p>According to his brother, Kohlhof is from Houston and had only been in San Antonio to help take care of his mother as she recovered from foot surgery.</p><p>Kohlhof is a volunteer, a handyman, an art lover and part-time pet sitter whose passions tragically center around his hands.</p><p>“Me and him talked about it. It’s not your hands that do all these great things. It’s your mind,” Greg told his brother.</p><p>“You’ll just have to find a new avenue to exercise it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma2pfqbK5rdJmpJqmXaG8tLHSZpmorJhirrO50manmqqkYryneceiqmaelZrBbq3FrZyrZZFiwKq6xqWcZp6cmq5ursitnGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./u2seven-better-than-the-real-thing-lyrics.html>&#171;&nbsp;U2sEven Better Than The Real Thing Lyrics</a>
