Now it's been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilbert himself has lost his life</a> due to a secret and lengthy battle with (at the time of this writing) an undisclosed illness. This has no doubt come as a massive shock to his cult-like fanbase who have closely followed his career ever since he first appeared on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>, an <a href=#>experience that Gilbert actually hated</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Gilbert's brief time on SNL, as well as his increasing popularity on the stand-up circuit, put him on a trajectory to success. Of course, Gilbert's career was never fully realized. This is something the comedian himself has stated in the past. His warped sense of humor, hilarious (if not outdated) impressions and unique personality hindered his reputation in the mainstream but built him an outlandishly dedicated following. Not only that, but it built him a healthy net worth which he leaves behind for his wife, Dara, and kids, Lily and Max, to enjoy.</p><h2 id=what-is-gilbert-gottfried-39-s-net-worth>What Is Gilbert Gottfried's Net Worth?</h2><p>Gilbert's sense of humor nor his personality, in general, was all that mainstream. But this is exactly why his fans adored him. And this was good enough for the powers-that-be to cast him in various projects, publish his utterly strange (and great) autobiography, "Rubber Balls And Liquor", and book him at comedy clubs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gilbert ruled at the Comedy Central Roasts, skewering the likes of <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>, Roseanne Barr, and, famously, Joan Rivers in a way that only he could. He made appearances in numerous movies like Beverly Hills Cop II, Dr. Doolittle, and voiced Iago in Aladdin. He was a regular guest on The <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show, lent his iconic voice to multiple shows and commercials, hosted an excellent podcast turned SiriusXM radio show, and was easily one of the filthiest, edgiest, and downright funniest stand-up comics of his generation.</p><p>Because of this, Celebrity Net Worth claims he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">left behind a net worth of $8 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=gilbert-gottfried-didn-39-t-like-to-spend-money>Gilbert Gottfried Didn't Like To Spend Money</h3><h3></h3><p>Gilbert loved to make fun of how cheap he was. And he had absolutely no problem with his comic friends namely Bob Saget, Jeff Ross, and Joan Rivers publicly ridiculing him for it.</p><p>The comedian didn't come from money. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, in a very lower-middle-class family. Gilbert claims to have had no discernable talent outside of occasionally making people laugh, imitating old celebrities, and doodling sexual images in his notebooks. But he was consumed by these talents and they led him to drop out of high school. Fortunately, Gilbert found a home in the comedy clubs which led him to join Saturday Night Live, the foundation of his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Controversial Jokes Norm Macdonald Ever Made About OJ Simpson On 'SNL'</a></span></p><p>While his film and television career wasn't everything he dreamed of, he looked as though he had a ton of fun. Especially in the stand-up world, where he was revered. His talents also helped him earn enough money to build a fantastic life for himself and his wife and kids. Together, they lived in a gorgeous Manhattan apartment until he passed on April 12th, 2022.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-gilbert-gottfried-make-from-cameo>How Much Money Did Gilbert Gottfried Make From Cameo?</h2><p>Gilbert Gottfried was the king of Cameo. While many B-list celebrities have turned to the direct-to-consumer app to make a few extra bucks, Gilbert actually did exceptionally well on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Howard Stern's Relationship With Norm Macdonald</a></span></p><p>Because of Gilbert's gut-splittingly funny voice and his ability to go down outrageous tangents, many of his fans wanted him to record greetings, outgoing messages, or insults for them. According to a 2021 article by The New York Post, Gilbert was the second-highest earner on Cameo, following The Office star Brian Baumgartner. He charged $175 per cameo video to fans and $950 per video to businesses. GoBankRates claim that he earned $450,000 from his short time on Cameo. His fans were clearly thrilled as he's very highly reviewed on the app.</p><h2 id=what-did-gilbert-gottfried-die-of>What Did Gilbert Gottfried Die Of?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Daily Mail</a>, Gilbert Gottfried passed away due to 'a heart abnormality' caused by his ongoing (and secret) battle with muscular dystrophy. He was just 67.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On April 12th, 2022, a statement was shared on all of Gilbert's socials, signed by his family. It read:</p><p>"We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our beloved Gilbert Gottfried after a long illness. In addition to being the most iconic voice in comedy, Gilbert was a wonderful husband, brother, friend, and father to his two young children. Although today is a sad day for all of us, please keep laughing as loud as possible in honor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given Gilbert's incredible ability to laugh at and make fun of some of the darkest aspects of society, it makes sense that he'd not want us to follow in grief. Instead, he'd want us to perfect our very best Jerry Seinfeld or Groucho Marx impression, send out a poorly-timed tweet or two, and always laugh when we're told we shouldn't.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Bob Saget And Louie Anderson's Relationship Before They Died</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydpp6rXZy2ra7Eq6tmn5%2Bpwae%2ByJ6bZqWRoLJuu81mmpqllaR6r7HTZq6oqqSdenN8kWtm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./monica-abbott.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Softball Player Monica Abbott?
