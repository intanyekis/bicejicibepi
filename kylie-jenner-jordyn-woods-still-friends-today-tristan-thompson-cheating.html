"I was drunk. I was not tipsy, I was drunk. But I was not beyond the point of recollection. I know where I was. But, on the way out [of Tristan's house] he did kiss me. No passion, no nothing. On the way out he just kissed me. It was a kiss on the lips. No tongue kiss, no making out. Nothing. I don't think he's wrong either, because I allowed myself to be in this position," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woods revealed</a>. "I didn't know how to feel. I was like, 'That didn't just happen,' because I was leaving already so I walked out immediately after. And I got in the car and was like, 'No, that didn't happen,' I [told him] I need to go. I was in shock."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-talked-about-jordyn-in-the-39-kuwtk-39-finale-in-2021><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kylie Jenner Talked About Jordyn In The 'KUWTK' Finale In 2021</span></h2><p>During the Keeping Up With Kardashians reunion which aired in June 2021, Kylie Jenner talked about her feelings toward Jordyn Woods. "Jordyn and I did have a talk after that," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the reality television star admitted</a>. "When we were friends, we never thought that we wouldn't be friends. It was kind of an overnight thing, and, you know, when she did something to my family, it felt like she did something to me." Considering that this was over two years after the incident, it's safe to say that the two have not given their friendship another chance. After the reunion aired, fans were not happy with the fact that <a href=#>Kylie is still blaming Jordyn, but not Tristan</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-khloe-kardashian-stand-in-the-way-of-kylie-and-jordyn-39-s-friendship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Does Khloe Kardashian Stand In The Way Of Kylie And Jordyn's Friendship?</span></h2><p>In the same reunion of Keeping Up With Kardashians, Khloe Kardashian clarified that she wouldn't mind if her sister Kylie Jenner rekindled her friendship with Jordyn Woods. "I have told Kylie intimately that I would genuinely not care whatsoever if Kylie wants to be her friend again," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe said</a>. "My sisters matter way more to me than any grudge or issue that I would have with another individual.
