But he said he was 21.</p><p>He may be physically 21, but he acts like he is about 15, emotionally and mature-wise. I think because he was raised by a bunch of Italian women who are known to baby the boys in the family. I imagine the Bensonhurst women fit that bill. They mean well.</p><p>I know because my Italian mom used to treat my brothers like that. When my sisters and I would complain about spoiling the boys, we were told the girls were more mature and could look after themselves with no problems.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Yes, he does act young. It’s really a shame because he is a cutie. I am hoping that it turns out that either Dante or Jason is his father. There is a reason he was brought to Port Charles. He told a couple people that his Dad was killed in action, but people say that when they want to cover up who the father is. Did they mention who his mother is? I missed that. It’s sad that he only knows his aunts, uncles, and cousins, no immediate family. I would think that Lois and Olivia must know something.</p><p>I heard Dante is leaving the show, so it’s probably not him. Jason already has 2 sons he is just getting to know, and Sonny has too many already, but he has provided for Gio most of his life. So maybe even Jagger?</p><p>Dante leaving? Hmmmm, that could open up a lot of story lines…</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>LULIX</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>June 27, 2024, 6:19am <span itemprop=position>6</span></span><p>Dante leaving again?
