Singer-songwriter. He is best known for his ’90s hits “Reno” and “I Don’t Call Him Daddy”.</p><p>After dropping out of college in 1979, he briefly worked on an oil rig before serving as a musician in local bands. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1987, where he found work as a session songwriter. After four years in Nashville, he moved back to Texas, where he founded a band called Texas Steel.</p><p>He began opening for national acts that came through Tyler, Texas and gained a wider following, eventually attracting the interest of Nashville label BNA Entertainment. His debut album, “Red and Rio Grande,” was released in 1993 and was certified gold. He earned a new male artist and song of the year nominations from the Academy of Country Music in 1993, but his second album “Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind,” released in 1994 was less successful. He switched labels and released a third album called “You Still Got Me,” in 1995, which produced a Top 5 country hit “Not Enough Hours in the Night.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=doug-supernaw-age></span>Doug Supernaw Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born as Douglas Anderson Supernaw on September 26, 1960, in Bryan, Texas, United States.

His death was announced on Friday by his record label. B&G Records said in a statement, “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Gold Record Country Artist, Doug Supernaw. He is survived by his third wife, his children, and his grandchildren.”</p><p>On February 4, 2019, Supernaw announced he had been battling Stage IV cancer in his lung and bladder. A post on the singer’s official Facebook account gave an overview of his condition: “After struggling with a prolonged cough, Doug was admitted to the hospital on January 25th, where it was determined he was suffering from Pneumonia. Additional tests found fluid on his heart and lungs which put his heart in an A-Fib condition. Additional tests also found a suspicious mass in his right lung. It was then determined that it was in Doug’s best interest that he be transferred to another Houston area hospital. It was at this hospital that his medical team confirmed several masses in his lungs, lymph nodes, bones, and bladder. The official diagnoses as of now is advanced, stage four, lung and bladder cancer. At this time, Doug remains in the hospital, awaiting more testing, while determining a treatment path.”</p><p>In October 2020, he was transferred to a hospice after the cancer tragically spread to his brain and spine. A statement released on his official Facebook page at the time said: “Hello everyone, I know it has been a long time since any real update, and for that, I appreciate your understanding. I have been hoping to not have to pass this information on to you, but, Doug’s cancer has spread to the brain and spine, and he is now under hospice care. I will update as much as I am able to; until then, please keep Doug in your thoughts and prayers, as you have been.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cause-of-death></span>Cause of Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Doug Supernaw’s cause of death was lung and bladder cancer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Doug Supernaw’s net worth was estimated to be $1 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmby2s4ysrKmdoqOuuL%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYyfmJysXZius7HEq2Sar5GnsbR5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./elliott-yamin-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Elliott Yamin Net Worth</a>
