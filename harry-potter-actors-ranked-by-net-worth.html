Everything is excessive and huge now, but before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was in swing, the Harry Potter films were showing audiences what could be done with a huge franchise. It even helped start the whole trend of turning the final film in a saga into two parts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Harry Potter series is full of lovable, fantastic actors that span generations, but it's interesting to look at how many of them have dwarfed their co-stars because of their work in the films. It can be difficult to determine just how much actors are worth and what they've done, especially when they enter the industry so young or have a storied careers.</p><h2 id=robbie-coltrane-rubeus-hagrid-4-million><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid): $4 Million</span></h2><p>The giant friend to Harry and company helped embody the lighter side of the Harry Potter series, but still played a very valuable role. It’s safe to say that everybody loves Hagrid. Coltrane was already a notable name in the UK before Harry Potter, so the film only bolstered his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moderate net worth.</a></p><h2 id=john-cleese-nearly-headless-nick-10-million><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick): $10 Million</span></h2><p>John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick is an enjoyable specter from the first two Harry Potter pictures when the series is considerably lighter in tone. Cleese makes for a fun appearance, but series like Monty Python and Fawlty Towers meant that Cleese was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">already quite famous</a>&nbsp;before being cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-gambon-professor-albus-dumbledore-15-million><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Michael Gambon (Professor Albus Dumbledore): $15 Million</span></h2><p>It's always difficult when projects have to scramble together and recast a role when something goes wrong or tragedy strikes. In Harry Potter’s case, Michael Gambon is a sublime substitute to play Dumbledore. Gambon's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">price tag was already a decent size</a> when the crew of&nbsp;Harry Potter approached him.</p><h2 id=maggie-smith-professor-minerva-mcgonagall-16-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Maggie Smith (Professor Minerva McGonagall): $16 Million</span></h2><p>It's such a joy to see all of the high caliber British talent that the Harry Potter films bring in through the various staff at Hogwarts. Maggie Smith is the perfect Minerva McGonagall and worth every penny of what it cost to acquire her, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which wasn't cheap</a>. She becomes one of Harry’s most affectionate mentors.</p><h2 id=john-hurt-garrick-ollivander-20-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>John Hurt (Garrick Ollivander): $20 Million</span></h2><p>John Hurt is another actor with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strong reputation</a> in both film and theater that made him a big name in the earlier Potter films. Ollivander may not be as important as other characters, but Hurt gives him a strong presence and makes sure that he makes a powerful impression on the young Harry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ralph-fiennes-lord-voldemort-30-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort): $30 Million</span></h2><p>It's never easy to cast the villain in a big, epic franchise. However, Ralph Fiennes' casting as He Who Shall Not Be Named is as perfect as it gets. Fiennes is no stranger to playing villains, but he really makes this one count, goes all out with his performance, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">justifies his price</a>.</p><h2 id=helena-bonham-carter-bellatrix-lestrange-30-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange): $30 Million</span></h2><p>Helena Bonham Carter has been popping up as the eccentric characters in films (and many Tim Burton ventures) for years now, which is why she's such a good fit for the unusual Bellatrix Lestrange. Helena Bonham Carter is a big name, so <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wasn't cheap</a>, but she's such a delight here.</p><h2 id=tom-felton-draco-malfoy-35-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy): $35 Million</span></h2><p>Draco Malfoy was a persistent thorn in Harry's side and Tom Felton brought the snide character to life with such wicked glee. Felton has gone on to steadily build his career as an actor, but his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is considerable</a> thanks to how he’s also a notable musician. It never hurts to be multi-talented.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Facts About The Harry Potter Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=gary-oldman-sirius-black-40-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gary Oldman (Sirius Black): $40 Million</span></h2><p>Gary Oldman is such a chameleon with the roles that he chooses and how he disappears into them. Appropriately, Oldman is given quite the complex character to play who must work through complex betrayal. His work in Harry Potter as Sirius Black is no exception. Oldman's lengthy career has made him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quite the hot commodity</a>.</p><h2 id=emma-thompson-professor-sybil-trelawney-45-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Emma Thompson (Professor Sybil Trelawney): $45 Million</span></h2><p>Emma Thompson is another esteemed member of the notable British actors that round out Harry Potter’s cast. Thompson gets to lean into her comedic sensibilities more with Sybil Trelawney, Hogwarts’ Divination expert. The results don’t disappoint, but it also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cost plenty to lock her in</a>. Thompson really gets to show her full range as the Professor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">25 Things In The Harry Potter Novels That Never Made It To The Movies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rupert-grint-ron-weasley-50-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley): $50 Million</span></h2><p>Rupert Grint, just like the other members of the films' "core trio," was unknown when&nbsp;he signed onto Harry Potter. Grint was acquired for cheap, with his price tag increasing with each picture until now he's sitting with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $50 million</a> from the films. Grint continues to give strong performances, but he may not find another role on the same caliber or scale as Ron Weasley.</p><h2 id=kenneth-branagh-professor-gilderoy-lockhart-55-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kenneth Branagh (Professor Gilderoy Lockhart): $55 Million</span></h2><p>Kenneth Branagh is a legend in both the acting and directing world and one of the best people to handle Shakespeare in the business. Branagh’s net worth was already high when he joined Harry Potter as Gilderoy Lockhart. Over the years, it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gotten even higher</a> thanks to endeavors like directing Thor.</p><h2 id=emma-watson-hermione-granger-70-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Emma Watson (Hermione Granger): $70 Million</span></h2><p>Even though Emma Watson was an unknown when Harry Potter started, like Grint and Radcliffe, the series turned her into a star. Her net worth has gotten <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even higher</a> than many of her co-stars thanks to the successful projects she picks, like Beauty and the Beast. Watson’s become a class act whose careful selection of roles has done her well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Actors Who Almost Landed Harry Potter Film Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=robert-pattinson-cedric-diggory-100-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Robert Pattinson (Cedric Diggory): $100 Million</span></h2><p>Robert Pattinson's turn as the duplicitous Cedric Diggory is a serious highlight in the Harry Potter films. Pattinson's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth has exploded</a> to massive levels thanks to how he's also a pillar to the ultra-profitable Twilight series, as well as other smart choices. His net worth is likely to get even higher now that he’s the next Batman, too.</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-harry-potter-110-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter): $110 Million</span></h2><p>Daniel Radcliffe was just a precocious child when the first Harry Potter began, but he's grown into a legitimate star in front of everyone's eyes. Radcliffe continues to work and take on smart roles, but he's definitely the one to benefit the most from Harry Potter and owes his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$110 million net worth</a> to it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Movies To Watch If You Like Harry Potter</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqqirnqxu9OtnKtlkZjBsL7SZqmappuasW6u2GalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./10-of-the-largest-slums-in-the-world.html>&#171;&nbsp;10 Of The Biggest Slums In The World</a>
