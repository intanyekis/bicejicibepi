He attended 15 schools in 14 years and faced lots of bullying for always being the new kid in town. <strong>This led to Cruise suffering from dyslexia</strong>, which had him placed in a remedial class.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2021-04-13_at_4-24-19_pm_480x480.png><p>Tom Cruise equally didn't have experience of what a healthy father-child relationship was with his dad. He attributed all he knew about fatherhood to his Stepdad John South, whom he never liked initially. He revealed:</p><p>In the beginning, I felt threatened by my stepfather. There’s a part of you that’s in love with your mother. But John is such a wise, smart man.
