Not only was Kelce at several of Swift's overseas concert dates on <strong>The Eras tour</strong> but the two have most recently been seen vacationing together during their downtime. And with the two wanting to "grow together," according to a source, not only might the relationship be taken to the next level, but Kelce's net worth will continue to grow as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-kelce-39-s-massive-popularity-is-boosting-his-career-and-net-worth>Travis Kelce's Massive Popularity Is Boosting His Career and Net Worth</h2><h3 id=travis-kelce-39-s-net-worth-has-grown-from-30-million-to-50-million-since-2023>Travis Kelce's net worth has grown from $30 million to $50 million since 2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Travis (and his career) is getting a lot more attention ever since the romance rumors began circulating, and that doesn’t just mean his name has been a constant fixture in the headlines. Swifties were responsible for helping NFL viewership soar, as many of Taylor’s fans tuned into all the Kansas City Chiefs' games to catch a glimpse of the singer watching her rumored beau.</p><p>Moreover, it appears that Travis is literally financially benefiting from his relationship with Taylor. In September 2023, it was reported that Travis Kelce <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jersey sales had recently increased by 400%</a>, speaking to the athlete’s <strong>spike in popularity thanks to his connection to Taylor.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis' net worth is currently $50 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth (while some sources report his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is closer to the $40 million range</a>). This is a huge jump of up to $20 million since his net worth was reported in 2023.</p><h2 id=travis-kelce-has-also-become-more-popular-on-social-media>Travis Kelce Has Also Become More Popular On Social Media</h2><h3 id=travis-kelce-39-s-social-media-followers-have-increased-substantially-since-dating-taylor-swift>Travis Kelce's social media followers have increased substantially since dating Taylor Swift</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51804042-1.jpg><p>All the newfound attention on Travis has also helped boost his online presence, which can turn into more career opportunities and financial gains.</p><p>It’s been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis gained over 1.3 million new followers on Instagram</a> since Taylor appeared at his first game. This is because fans were eager to know more about the NFL star (as well as see the pair make their romance Instagram-official). <strong>Now, Travis has 6.4 million followers on Instagram, whereas he was at 2.8 million before the game</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, his following has increased on other platforms, too. He’s gained over 500,000 new followers on TikTok, for a total of 2.6 million followers, as well as 25,000 on X (formerly known as Twitter), for a total of 1.3 million followers.</p><p>This isn’t just good publicity but can also help boost Travis’ personal fortune thanks to brand deals and endorsements. With more intrigue surrounding Travis than ever, it’s likely he’ll see an increase in brands trying to partner with him to take part in the exposure around his romance with Taylor. Influencers can make tens of thousands of dollars from posting sponsored content. Anyone with over a million followers is considered a “mega influencer” and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">typically charges between $5,000 to $25,000</a> per sponsored post, though it can be higher. Typically, the more followers one has, the more the person can charge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, the price also often depends on the influencer’s engagement – and Travis' socials likely have a lot of comments filled with people discussing and questioning his romance with Taylor. Needless to say, he can literally cash in on their romance by using his increased online following to his advantage.</p><p>Many companies have already used Taylor and Travis’ romance as a marketing opportunity, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heinz, who’s launching an exclusive “Ketchup and Allegedly Ranch” sauce</a>, based on a concoction Taylor was seen snacking on when attending one of Travis’ game. They’re only releasing 100 bottles, but the buzz the sauce has caused makes for a priceless advertisement for Heinz as a brand. It likely won’t be long until Travis is getting a piece of the profits from similar collaborations wanting to benefit off of the Taylor Swift rumors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_taylor-swift-s-grammy-record-may-have-impacted-her-net-worth-nearly-as-much-as-the-eras-tour_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Grammy Record May Have Impacted Her Net Worth Nearly As Much As The Eras Tour</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>How much money will Taylor Swift earn because of her impressive and historical Grammy win in 2024?</span><h2 id=rumors-suggest-travis-kelce-may-be-in-it-with-taylor-swift-for-the-fame>Rumors Suggest Travis Kelce May Be In It With Taylor Swift For The Fame</h2><h3 id=travis-kelce-39-s-ex-has-made-claims-that-his-intentions-with-taylor-swift-may-not-be-as-pure-as-they-appear>Travis Kelce's ex has made claims that his intentions with Taylor Swift may not be as pure as they appear</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-travis-kelce.jpg><p>With all the good Travis’ romance with Taylor is doing for his career, it’s plausible that the athlete’s main motivation in dating the singer is to advance his personal brand. This theory is supported by the fact that Travis’ ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Maya Benberry recently issued Taylor a public warning</a> to be careful of him.</p><p>In a recent interview with Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maya claimed Travis cheated on her</a> during their time together and implied he may be using Taylor for his own advantage. “Taylor seems like such a fun girl with a beautiful spirit so I wish her the best of luck but I wouldn’t be a girls' girl if I didn’t advise her to be smart!” Maya said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m sure by now she has mastered the ability to see who is really there for her - and who is just using her,” she went on. “I can only hope that she comes out the teacher in this situation and not the student.”</p><p>“The man that I knew him to be when we dated,” Maya added. “Only time will tell but like the saying always goes, once a cheater, always a cheater.”</p><p><strong>Travis and Maya began dating in 2016</strong> after she won his reality television competition Catching Kelce, where she competed with 49 other contestants for the NFL star’s heart.</p><p>However, their romance was short-lived, as Maya claims she discovered he was seeing sports broadcast Kayla Nicole at the same time. Kayla and Travis (who later faced infidelity allegations in their relationship) dated on-and-off until 2022.</p><p>Source: Elle</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lnprBbsPOq6uhZZOdrq%2BzxJ1kn6qfonq1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMq6ammZ6YsnA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./frank-deal.html>&#171;&nbsp;Into The Life Of Frank Deal</a>
