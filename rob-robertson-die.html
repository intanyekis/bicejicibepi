During his time as president, Rob was passionate about making a positive impact both on and off the field. He implemented various changes and initiatives that brought the club back into the spotlight, and he was actively involved in ventures outside the club.</p><p>One of his most significant accomplishments was establishing the Women’s cricket team and introducing Lisa Chesters MP to the club, who was instrumental in guiding the club’s redevelopment works. He also re-established the Ken Wust Oval Sports Action Group and represented all sporting groups in meetings with the council. Despite his busy schedule, Rob was always there for the club, putting on his whites to help out or randomly turning up at games and treating all members equally.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rajasdentalcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/332934300_1182834195759811_3497022619044757538_n.webp><p>Even during his poor health, he continued to follow the club, keep in contact with players, and drop into a few matches. He was selfless, always putting the club and its members first.
