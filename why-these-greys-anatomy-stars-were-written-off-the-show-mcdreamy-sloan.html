Some actors were let go due to backstage drama, some were dramatically killed off and others were written out with heartbreaking goodbyes.Some of that behind-the-scenes turmoil that caused former Grey's Anatomy stars to be written out from the hit Shondaland drama is practically as dramatic and compelling as any on the ABC show's on-screen plots. Here are some reasons certain actors and characters were written of Grey's Anatomy during the 17 years it has been on air.<span class=article-alert>Spoiler Alert!
