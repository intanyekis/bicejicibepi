Some actors were let go due to backstage drama, some were dramatically killed off and others were written out with heartbreaking goodbyes.Some of that behind-the-scenes turmoil that caused former Grey's Anatomy stars to be written out from the hit Shondaland drama is practically as dramatic and compelling as any on the ABC show's on-screen plots. Here are some reasons certain actors and characters were written of Grey's Anatomy during the 17 years it has been on air.<span class=article-alert>Spoiler Alert!

Knight, who came out as gay shortly after. While Washington initially denied the accusations, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor later released a statement apologizing for what he said</a>.</p><p>In 2007, Washington was confirmed to not be returning to the drama.

In 2007, Walsh left to enjoy her own spin-off show Private Practice. It saw Dr. Montgomery in a new location with new characters.

Brooke Smith was ultimately let go after the fifth season.</p><h2 id=katherine-heigl-left-greys-anatomy-to-be-a-mother><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Katherine Heigl Left 'Greys Anatomy' To Be A Mother</span></h2><p>Katherine Heigl is probably one of the more famous actresses to come out of Grey's Anatomy, becoming a household name thanks to her Emmy-winning performance as Dr. Izzie Stevens.

It was between me and the writers. I ambushed them, and it wasnât very nice or fair," the star admitted much later.</p><p>Heigl says the real reason she quit the show in 2010 was because she had become a first-time mother.
