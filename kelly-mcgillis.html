She is an American actress known for her outstanding acting skills in various movies and TV series.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from acting, she has also worked as the co-producer in the 1991-released drama movie&nbsp;<i>Grand Isle</i>. Although Kelly is quite frank about her professional career in the media, she is not the same regarding her personal life. So many of her fans and followers are curious to know about those data.</p><p>In this blog post today, we will have a detailed look into the Love Finds You in Sugarcreek actress Kelly's personal and relationship status.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kelly Mcgillis Relationship With Melanie Leis:&nbsp;</h2><p>Kelly was previously married to the American sales executive and theatre artist&nbsp;<strong>Melanie Leis</strong>. She first met her ex-spouse in a bar in West Florida in early 2000.</p><p>Soon after, they became friends with each other. They went on to a friend's birthday party and became close to each other. By the end of 2001, they were dating each other and started living together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/16/VOWS-1-articleLarge-1668587894682.jpg><p>Despite having a same-sex relationship, it did not bring much change to their love relationship. Kelly McGillis and Melanie Leis separated in 2009, and the main reason was that they had changed and grown at different rates. However, they started dating again.</p><p>On September 15, 2010, the former couple tied the knot in a wedding ceremony in front of 11 guests. However, their marriage relationship did not last long as they got seperated from each other in 2011 due to some personal reasons.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kelly's Other Relationships Before Melanie Leis:&nbsp;</h2><p>Apart from Melanie Leis, Kelly has also been in a married relationship with&nbsp;<strong>Boyd Black&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Fred Tillman</strong>. In 1979, she exchanged vows for the first time with Boyd Black. However, the relationship between them did not go well as anticipated. By the end of 1981, they got divorced each other.</p><p>On New Year's Eve in 1988, Kelly tied the knot with an American Yacht Broker, Fred Tillman, in Los Angeles, California. After the wedding ceremony, they moved to Key West, Florida, and started a new life as a married couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/16/image-1668587989909%20(1)-1668588681259.jpeg><p>The former couple was living a pleased and peaceful life in Key West, Florida. However, their relationship started falling apart, and the couple finally divorced in 2002 after fourteen years of marriage.</p><p>However, they have not still disclosed any particular reason behind their separation. More importantly, this ex-couple welcomed two beautiful daughters from their thirteen years of marriage journey.</p><h2>Has Kelly Married Again After Having Three Unsuccessful Marriages?</h2><p>Kelly McGillis is currently single at the moment and is not married to anyone, nor is she dating anyone at present. After being seperated from her previous spouse in 2011, she has not been seen together with anyone we can assume to be her boyfriend or, rather, husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/16/kelly-mcgillis-03-800-a07ff999192046adaece6dc7c4fe279e%20(1)-1668587797470.jpeg><p>Moreover, Kelly seems to have no interest in using social media handles and has not yet opened any profile on famous social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. So it takes a lot of work to trace her daily activities and her hookups.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, <i>In the Best of Families: Marriage, Pride & Madness </i>actress Kelly might be dating someone she adores the most and may not like to reveal it on the surface, or she may be single.&nbsp;</p><h2>About Kelly's Net Worth & Earnings:&nbsp;</h2><p>Kelly McGillis has made an enormous fortune through her professional acting career. She has&nbsp;a <a href=#>total net worth of $4 million,&nbsp;</a>including her house, cars, bank balance, and other assets.</p><p>Her primary source of income is her acting career. She has appeared in more than fifty-four movies and TV series since starting her acting career. And in most of the films, she has been portrayed as the main character.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kelly Is The Mother Of Two Children</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Kelly has given birth to two beautiful daughters from her marriage relationship with the American Yacht Broker Fred Tillman.</p><p><i>An Uncommon Grace </i>actress Kelly gave birth to her eldest daughter on May 24, 1990. Her eldest daughter's name is&nbsp;<strong>Kelsey Tillman</strong>. Likewise, her second daughter&nbsp;<strong>Sonora Tillman</strong>&nbsp;was born on April 10, 1993.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsuburb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kesley-Tillman-Age.jpg><p>However, both of her daughters like to live a low-profile life and want to live a private life away from the lame light. So only a little is known about their professional and personal life.</p><h2>Dropped Out Of High School To Pursue Acting</h2><p>As previously mentioned, Kelly intentionally dropped out of high school to pursue a career as an actress. After dropping out of high school, she went to Juilliard in Manhattan and the Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA, to take acting classes.</p><p>Although it was a tough decision for her to leave high school, she took the bait and pursued what she liked, and the rest is history.</p><h2>Did Kelly Mcgillis Lose Her Weight?</h2><p>Kelly might have<a href=#>&nbsp;had a weight loss</a>&nbsp;as she is seen more fit in her recent appearance out in public. As you know, the required body measurement for a Hollywood actress is not being fat or prominent but rather a well-maintained slim body.</p><p>So for this sole purpose, Kelly might have decreased her body by exercising regularly. In an Interview with ET the Top Gun actress stated,</p><p><i>“I’m old and fat and I look age-appropriate for my age, and that’s not what that whole scene is about. But … I’d much rather feel absolutely secure in my skin and who and what I am at my age as opposed to placing a value on all that other stuff.”</i></p><h2>Was Born In Newport Beach</h2><p>Kelly was born in Newport Beach, California, to Virginia Joan on <strong>July 9, 1957</strong>, into a middle-class family. Her birth name is Kelly Ann McGillis, whereas cancer is her birth sign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/16/kellymcgills-2%20(1)-1668588581442.jpeg><p><i>Top Gun </i>actress Kelly was keenly intrested in acting from an early age and used to spend her free time memorizing and repeating the dialogue of several actresses. At the age of twenty-six, she started her acting journey.</p><h2>Have A Look Into Kelly Family Member</h2><p>Kelly Mcgillis was born as the first child among the three siblings of her father, <strong>Donald Manson McGillis</strong>, and mother, <strong>Virginia Joan </strong>(Snell). Her father was a general medicine practitioner, and his mother was a homemaker.</p><p>Moreover, She has a young brother named Karen McGillis, who is two years younger than herself. Karen was born on July 1959. Likewise, her younger sister, Kathleen McGillis, was born on August 1961.</p><h2>Physical Apperance & Body Measurement:</h2><p>Kelly is a gorgeous actress who stands at a decent height of 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Livia Giuggioli </a>while having an average body weight of 74 kg (163 pounds).&nbsp;</p><p>She has dark brown eyes and blonde hair.
